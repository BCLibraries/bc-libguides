## Boston College Libraries LibApps templates

This repository contains the template code used to customize our LibApps instances. 
These templates are meant to be copied/pasted directly into each respective application's Look & Feel screen. There are also additional group-level LibGuides templates.

### LibCal and LibAnswers templates

Custom templates for [LibCal](/LibCal) and [LibAnswers](/LibAnswers) include a common header and footer. These are nearly identical to the header and footer used in LibGuides. 

### LibGuides System templates

The template files with the ***LibGuides_system_*** prefix are system-wide. 
There are a few common templates such as [header](/LibGuides/LibGuides_system_header.html) and [footer](/LibGuides/LibGuides_system_footer.html) code that are referenced throughout many of the templates.

Other system-level templates are included:
* [A-Z](/LibGuides/LibGuides_template_az.html)
* [Profile](/LibGuides/LibGuides_template_profile.html)
* [Search](/LibGuides/LibGuides_template_search.html)
* [Subject](/LibGuides/LibGuides_template_subject.html)

### LibGuides Group templates

Template code for several group templates are also included and are designated with a ***LibGuides_template_*** prefix. 
Often times these groups will reuse the common header and footer templates. Custom header and footer code for group templates are named appropriately for easy identification.

### Static files

The static css, js and image files linked within these templates can be located in the [BC-libraries-site repository](https://github.com/BCLibraries/bc-libraries-site/tree/master/themes/bc/static).

Please don't hotlink to our static files but rather host them on your own server.
