## Boston College Libraries LibGuides templates

This repository contains the literal template code used to customize our LibGuides instance. 
These templates are meant to be copied/pasted directly into the LibGuides Look & Feel input boxes or the group page layout input boxes.

### System templates

The template files with the ***system_*** prefix are system-wide. 
There are a few common templates such as [header](/templates/system_header.html) and [footer](/templates/system_footer.html) code that are referenced throughout many of the templates.

Other system-level templates are included:
* [A-Z](/templates/template_az.html)
* [Profile](/templates/template_profile.html)
* [Search](/templates/template_search.html)
* [Subject](/templates/template_subject.html)

### Group templates

Template code for several group templates are also included and are designated with a ***template_group_*** prefix. 
Often times these groups will reuse the common header and footer templates. Custom header and footer code for group templates are named appropriately for easy identification.

### Static files

The static css, js and image files linked within these templates can be located in the [BC-libraries-site repository](https://github.com/BCLibraries/bc-libraries-site/tree/master/themes/bc/static).

Please don't hotlink to our static files but rather host them on your own server.
